## Tips for Users

- For best results, select a reasonable amount of text (a paragraph or two) rather than entire pages.
- Experiment with different actions to see which ones work best for your needs.
- Use the "Custom Prompt" feature for specific instructions or unique use cases.
- If you're not satisfied with a result, try the "Regenerate" button for a different output.
- The extension works on most websites, but some may have restrictions that prevent text selection or script injection.

## Privacy and Data Usage

Pluto processes text locally in your browser and only sends the selected text to OpenAI's API for processing. No data is stored on our servers. However, please be mindful of the text you process, especially if it contains sensitive information.

## Troubleshooting

- If the extension isn't working, make sure you've entered a valid OpenAI API key.
- Check that you have an active internet connection, as the extension requires online access to function.
- If you encounter any issues, try refreshing the page or restarting your browser.
